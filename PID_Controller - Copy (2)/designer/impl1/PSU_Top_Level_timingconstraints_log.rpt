Global Nets Whose Drivers Are Limited to Quadrants or Which Have No Valid Locations:

        |--------------------------------------------|

Info: Consider relaxing the constraints for these nets by removing region constraints,
      unassigning fixed cells and I/Os, relaxing I/O bank assignments, or using input
      buffers without hardwired pad connections.
Error: PLC003: No legal global assignment could be found because of complex region and/or IO
       technology constraints.
Error: PLC005: Automatic global net placement failed.
INFO: See the GlobalNet Report from the Reports option of the Tools menu for information about
the global assignment.
